# 🔗 Connection State Management - Fixed!

## ✅ What's Fixed

Your Mi Band connection now **maintains state** and handles device reauthorization automatically!

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: First Time Connection
1. Click "Open Band"
2. 5-step process runs
3. Device connects
4. State is maintained

### Scenario 2: Device Not Found (Browser Restart, New Tab, etc.)
1. Click "Open Band"
2. System detects device not found
3. **Automatically prompts for reauthorization**
4. You select your band from the list
5. System verifies it's the correct band (checks MAC address)
6. Updates device ID in database
7. Continues with connection
8. **No need to re-add the band!**

---

## 🔄 Auto-Reauthorization Process

When you see "Device not found. Requesting new authorization...":

### Step 1: Device Selection Popup
- Browser shows Bluetooth device picker
- Select your Mi Band 4 from the list

### Step 2: Verification
- System reads MAC address
- Compares with stored MAC address
- Ensures you selected the correct band

### Step 3: Update Database
- Saves new device ID
- Updates band record
- Maintains all your settings

### Step 4: Continue Connection
- Proceeds with normal 5-step process
- Authenticates with your stored auth key
- Loads all data

## 💡 Why This Happens

### Browser Bluetooth Limitations
- **Device IDs change** between sessions
- **Permissions reset** on browser restart
- **New tabs** don't share device access (unless persistent permissions enabled)

### Our Solution
- **Detect when device is missing**
- **Prompt for reauthorization**
- **Verify it's the same band**
- **Update and continue**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Connection Flow

```typescript
1. Check for existing authorized device
   ↓
2. If found → Continue to step 5
   ↓
3. If not found → Request new device
   ↓
4. Verify MAC address matches
   ↓
5. Update device ID in database
   ↓
6. Continue with authentication
   ↓
7. Connect and load data
```

### State Persistence

**What's Stored:**
- ✅ Band nickname
- ✅ MAC address
- ✅ Auth key
- ✅ Device ID (updated automatically)
- ✅ Activity goals
- ✅ Settings
- ✅ All preferences

**What's Not Stored:**
- ❌ Bluetooth device object (can't be stored)
- ❌ Connection state (session-only)

### Auto-Update Mechanism
```typescript
// If device not found
if (!bluetoothDevice) {
  // Request new authorization
  const newDevice = await requestDevice();
  
  // Verify it's the same band
  const mac = await getBandMac(newDevice);
  if (mac !== band.macAddress) {
    throw new Error("Wrong device");
  }
  
  // Update device ID
  await updateBandForId(band.id, { 
    deviceId: newDevice.id 
  });
  
  // Continue with new device
  bluetoothDevice = newDevice;
}
```
