   - ✅ Watch the live camera feed activate

3. **Test Exercise Detection**
   - ✅ Automatic rep counting every 3-5 seconds
   - ✅ Audio feedback: "Good rep!" on each count
   - ✅ Exercise stage changes: "detecting" → "completed" → "detecting"
   - ✅ Joint angle simulation updates
   - ✅ Performance stats (FPS, duration, reps)

4. **Test Controls**
   - ✅ Pause/Resume session
   - ✅ Stop session
   - ✅ Reset counter
   - ✅ Toggle audio feedback

### 📊 **Expected Behavior**

**When you start a session:**

- Check console for errors (F12)
- Ensure the route is correctly added
- Verify the component import

### 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when you see:
- ✅ Live camera feed
- ✅ Automatic rep counting
- ✅ Audio "Good rep!" feedback
- ✅ Real-time stats updating
- ✅ Smooth UI interactions
- ✅ Professional exercise interface

### 📱 **Next Steps After Testing**
