## Verify No Breaking Changes

### Test Existing Pages

Visit each page and verify it loads without new errors:

1. ✅ Dashboard: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard`
2. ✅ Analytics: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/analytics`
3. ✅ Chatbot: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/chatbot`
4. ✅ Computer Vision: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/computer-vision`
5. ✅ Disease Detection: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/disease-detection`
6. ✅ Vaccination Tracker: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/vaccination-tracker`
7. ✅ Exercise Guidance: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/exercise-guidance`
8. ✅ Ambulance Services: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/ambulance-services`
9. ✅ Doctor Categories: `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/doctor-categories`

**Expected Result:**
- All pages load normally
- No new console errors related to Mi Band
- Sidebar shows "Mi Band 4" link with Watch icon

## Browser Console Checks

### Expected Console Messages (Normal)

```
[Authentication]: OK
Fetching data from [timestamp]
```

### No Mi Band Errors Should Appear

The following should NOT appear:
- ❌ "Cannot find module 'miband'"
- ❌ "MiBandContext is undefined"
- ❌ "Failed to load band-connection"

### Existing Errors (Unrelated to Mi Band)

These errors are from existing code and not caused by Mi Band integration:
- Leaflet map context warnings (AmbulanceServices)
- Framer Motion version mismatch warning
- SVG attribute errors (from existing components)

## Data Persistence Test

### IndexedDB Verification

1. Open DevTools → Application → IndexedDB
2. Look for database: `miband4-web-db`
3. Check object stores:
   - `bands` - Should contain added bands
   - `config` - Should contain configuration
   - `activityData` - Will be populated when activity data is fetched

**Expected Result:**
- Database exists
- Bands are persisted
- Data survives page refresh

### Test Data Persistence

1. Add a band
2. Refresh the page
3. **Expected:** Band still appears in the list

## Performance Checks

### Page Load Time

- Mi Band page should load in < 2 seconds
- No significant impact on other pages

### Memory Usage

- Check DevTools → Performance → Memory
- Mi Band context should not cause memory leaks
- Disconnecting from band should free resources

## Error Handling Tests

### Test Error Scenarios

1. **Wrong Auth Key:**
   - Enter incorrect authentication key
   - **Expected:** Error message: "Incorrect auth key"

2. **Device Out of Range:**
   - Try to connect when band is far away
   - **Expected:** Error message: "Failed to connect"

3. **Cancel Device Selection:**
   - Click "Select Device" then cancel
   - **Expected:** No errors, can try again

4. **Disconnect During Operation:**
   - Connect to band
   - Turn off Bluetooth
   - Try to read data
   - **Expected:** Error message, can reconnect

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] Mi Band page loads without errors
- [ ] Browser compatibility check works
- [ ] Can add a band (with physical device)
- [ ] Can view band details
- [ ] Can connect to band
- [ ] Can read battery, status, device info
- [ ] Can set activity goal
- [ ] Can sync time
- [ ] Can find band (vibrate)
- [ ] Can edit band
- [ ] Can delete band
- [ ] Data persists after refresh
- [ ] Sidebar shows Mi Band link
- [ ] All existing pages still work
- [ ] No new console errors on other pages
- [ ] IndexedDB stores data correctly

## Troubleshooting

### "Web Bluetooth is not supported"

**Solution:** Use Chrome or Edge browser

### "Failed to connect to device"

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
2. Ensure band is nearby
3. Ensure band is not connected to another device
4. Try restarting browser
5. Check browser Bluetooth permissions

### "Incorrect auth key"

**Solution:** Get correct auth key from Mi Fit app or Gadgetbridge

### TypeScript Errors in IDE

**Note:** Some TypeScript errors about `BluetoothDevice` are expected because the Web Bluetooth API types are not fully recognized by all IDEs. The code will run correctly in the browser.

## Success Criteria

✅ **Integration is successful if:**
1. Mi Band page loads and functions correctly
2. Can add, edit, and delete bands
3. Can connect and control band (with physical device)
4. No breaking changes to existing functionality
5. Data persists correctly
6. No memory leaks or performance issues

## Notes

- The integration uses Web Bluetooth API which is only available in certain browsers
- A physical Mi Band 4 device is required for full testing
- Authentication key must be obtained from Mi Fit app or Gadgetbridge
- All Mi Band code is isolated and won't affect existing features
