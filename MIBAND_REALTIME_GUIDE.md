## 🔧 Technical Details

### Auto-Refresh Mechanism
- **Interval**: 5 seconds
- **What it fetches**:
  - Device info
  - Battery level
  - Current status (steps, distance, calories)
  - Band time
- **Smart refresh**: Errors are logged but don't stop auto-refresh

### Connection Process
Each step has specific callbacks:
1. `onSearching()` - Triggered when scanning starts
2. `onConnecting()` - Triggered when connection begins
3. `onGettingService()` - Triggered when accessing services
4. `onAuthenticating()` - Triggered during authentication

### Data Updates
- **Silent mode**: Auto-refresh errors don't show alerts
- **Timestamp tracking**: Every update records exact time
- **State management**: React hooks manage all state
- **Cleanup**: Intervals cleared on disconnect
